        The visuals below are based on 406 Ammunition’s 2020 sales data. The data is accompanied by analysis and suggestions based on best practices in the marketing industry. Due to the data’s nature, this sales data is very limited in scope and other major market factors (manufacturing, material acquisition, labor, etc.) go largely unaccounted for in the analysis and the data’s visualization.

      Revenue for 406 Ammunition has seemed grow rapidly over the course of April – June 2020. A reasonable understanding of the root cause of this growth, is the citizens of the United States responses to COVID-19. Along with toilet paper, the population of the US flocked to arms and ammunition stores, gathering as much as they could. An NPR article from March of 2020 that spoke to the increased demand on guns and ammunition from the Coronavirus crisis (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/817369503/some-stock-up-on-guns-and-ammunition-during-coronavirus-crisis">link</a>). Whatever the cause may be of the revenue growth over the early parts of 2020, the increased revenue stabilized at the increased rate for the remainder of the year in the range of [$250,000, $325,000] from that of ~$50,000 in the earlier parts of the year.

      In a current ammunition market, there are constrained materials that make supply limited, especially primers. When ammunition can be produced, the supply is flying off the shelves as fast as it can be manufactured. However, this time of exposure and increased demand can be leveraged to a great degree and allow for 406 Ammunition to maintain the growth that has experienced in the recent months. 
      <br>
      <br>
      As seen above, the number of unique customers per month has increased dramatically over the course of 2020. By increasing visibility to such a high degree, 406 Ammunition can continue to offer the individuals product even when supply is no longer constrained. To capture all the new customers (both individuals and businesses), it is imperative that customers begin to build loyalty, this applies to both business partners and individual consumers. Building customer loyalty is no easy feat, however, there are many tools that can be employed to begin a long-term relationship with the customers. To engender loyalty and retain customers, 406 Ammunition will have to sacrifice short-term gains for life-time value. A few ways to generate life-time value are building loyalty programs, where consumers are incentivized to make repeat purchases, offering products at a discount as a part of a loyalty program are two of the most common techniques. To leverage the increased customer base, 406 Ammunition needs to generate loyalty from its customers – which will offer vast amounts long-term value and revenue.

      The amount of revenue captured is largely derived from three main states - California, Texas, and Montana. It is clear that a few markets are on the verge of becoming a main region for 406 Ammunition, such as Idaho, Colorado, and Arizona – these could be a source of future revenue by expanding business into these regions. 
      <br>
      <br>
      As normal production of ammunition resumes in the future, ensure that 406 Ammunition can maintain its ‘foothold’ in the market. When supply of materials for ammunition manufacturing becomes abundant again, the competition for the most inexpensive or highest quality ammunition will resume between ammunition manufacturers. When this competition resumes, 406 Ammunition must be ready to edge into an aspect of the wider ammunition industry, expanding beyond just a local manufacturer. To do this, the ammunition will have to be differentiated from competitors in its form (the way the product is offered), class (the perceived or actual quality differentiations between products), and category (the grouping of products that are optimized for a certain interest-based group – i.e., personal defense, tactical training, or law enforcement). By differentiating the products from 406 Ammunition’s competitors, the market share that has been captured in regions and customers due to limited supply can be maintained even after the supply is no longer constrained.
